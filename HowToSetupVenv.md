I'll help you create and set up a Python virtual environment for your project. Here's how to do it:

1. Use the **Python: Create Environment** command to create a new virtual environment for your project.


Show in Command Palette

 prompted, select "Venv" as the environment type and choose your Python interpreter version.

3. If you have a requirements.txt file, it will be automatically detected and the dependencies will be installed. If you don't have one, create a new file named `requirements.txt` in your project root to list your project dependencies.

4. After the environment is created, make sure it's selected as your Python interpreter using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command.


Show in Command Palette

 the path to your virtual environments using the **python.venvPath** setting.
```
{
  "python.venvPath": "~/.virtualenvs"
}
```

Show in Settings Editor

 environment will be automatically activated when you open a new terminal in VS Code. Your packages will be isolated from other Python projects and the global Python installation.

To install new packages, you can use `pip install <package-name>` in the terminal and then save your dependencies to requirements.txt using `pip json > requirements.txt`.
