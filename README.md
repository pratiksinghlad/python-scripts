# OOP Examples

This folder contains simple, focused Python scripts demonstrating core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

Files:

- `function_method.py` - example of module-level functions, nested functions, and class methods (already present).
- `oop_basics.py` - instance methods, class methods, static methods, class/instance attributes.
- `inheritance_polymorphism.py` - base class, derived classes, method overriding and polymorphism.
- `encapsulation_example.py` - private attributes, properties, deposit/withdraw example.
- `abstraction_interface.py` - abstract base class (`abc.ABC`) with concrete implementation.
- `dataclass_example.py` - using `@dataclass` and frozen dataclass.
- `composition_example.py` - composition relationship (Car has an Engine).
- `magic_methods.py` - demonstrates `__str__`, `__add__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`.
- `exceptions_example.py` - custom exception class usage.

How to run:

Open a terminal in this folder and run any example with Python 3:

```bash
python oop_basics.py
python inheritance_polymorphism.py
python encapsulation_example.py
python abstraction_interface.py
python dataclass_example.py
python composition_example.py
python magic_methods.py
python exceptions_example.py
python function_method.py
```

Requirements:

- Python 3.7+ (for `dataclasses` on Python 3.7; on 3.10+ it's built-in and used here by default)

Each file is standalone and prints a short demonstration when executed. Use them as learning references or modify them to experiment further.
