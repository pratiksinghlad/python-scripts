# Python Scripts - Main Project Folder

This is the main project folder for the Python Learning Examples collection. The examples have been organized into logical subfolders for better navigation and learning progression.

## 📁 Current Structure

```
python-scripts/
├── basics/           # Basic Python operations and file handling
├── oop/             # Object-Oriented Programming examples
├── data-science/    # Data analysis and visualization libraries
├── utilities/       # System utilities and helper functions
├── games/           # Game development examples (coming soon)
├── gui/             # GUI application examples (coming soon)
├── Examples/        # Legacy folder (being phased out)
├── logs/            # Log files and output (auto-generated)
├── .venv/           # Virtual environment (created during setup)
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
└── README.md        # This file
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Set up environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Explore categories**:
   - Start with `basics/` for fundamental concepts
   - Move to `oop/` for object-oriented programming
   - Try `data-science/` for data analysis libraries
   - Use `utilities/` for practical system tools

3. **Run examples**:

   ```bash
   cd basics
   python file_json_example.py
   ```

## 📚 Learning Categories

See the main `Examples/README.md` for a comprehensive overview of all available examples and learning paths.

## 🔄 Migration Note

This folder previously contained all examples directly. They have been reorganized into topic-specific subfolders (`basics/`, `oop/`, `data-science/`, `utilities/`) for better organization and easier navigation.

The `Examples/` folder contains the main project documentation and overview.
